Make sure Quanser Interactive Labs is open and cityscape is selected, and then run "run.bat" and it will do everything

Note:

The controller code is programmed to stop at stop signs for 5 seconds regardless of circumstance, and stop at yield signs for 3 seconds regardless of circumstance. It is also very specific to the node sequences I have my cars follow, as well as the placement of objects in the environment, so if you modify the environment/node sequences, you may run into issues.

The Training_model.py file is for training a yolov8 model that you've downloaded. The paths won't work because they're local to my PC.

The v2x_helpers.py is a standalone script to run just v2x on both QCars. The main program ran from "run.bat" utilizes both perception and v2x. It is good for visualizing and modifying the geofences.

Additionally, for the controller to properly work each of your roboflow classes must be labeled exactly as such (case sensitive):

"green_light"

"pedestrian"

"Qcar"

"red_light"

"stop_sign"

"yield_sign"
